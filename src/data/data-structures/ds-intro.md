# Introduction to Data Structures

Learn the fundamental building blocks of efficient programming.

## Overview

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and managing data in computer memory. They are the foundation of computer science and essential for writing efficient algorithms and solving complex programming problems.

Think of data structures as different ways to organize information, just like how you might organize books on a shelf, files in a cabinet, or contacts in your phone. Each organization method has its strengths and is optimized for different types of operations.

Understanding data structures is crucial because:
- They directly impact the performance of your programs
- They help you choose the right tool for each problem
- They form the backbone of system design and architecture
- They're essential for technical interviews and competitive programming

We'll explore both linear data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues) and non-linear structures (trees, graphs, hash tables), learning when and how to use each one effectively.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what data structures are and why they matter
- Learn to analyze time and space complexity (Big O notation)
- Master fundamental linear data structures like arrays and linked lists
- Implement and use stacks and queues for problem-solving
- Explore non-linear structures including trees and graphs
- Choose appropriate data structures for different scenarios
