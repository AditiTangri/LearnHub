# Introduction to Blockchain Technology

Discover the revolutionary technology behind cryptocurrencies and Web3.

## Overview

Blockchain is a revolutionary distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Think of it as a digital ledger that's shared across multiple computers, making it nearly impossible to hack or manipulate.

Unlike traditional databases controlled by a single entity, blockchain operates on a decentralized network where multiple participants (nodes) maintain copies of the same ledger. This creates a system that's transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship.

**Key characteristics of blockchain include:**
- Decentralization: No single point of control or failure
- Immutability: Once data is recorded, it's extremely difficult to change
- Transparency: All transactions are visible to network participants
- Security: Cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms protect the data
- Trust: The system enables trust between parties without intermediaries

This technology powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond digital money to include supply chain management, digital identity, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps).
