# Consensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols that ensure all participants in a blockchain network agree on the current state of the ledger.

## Common Types
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Requires computational work to validate transactions (e.g., Bitcoin).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Stakeholders vote for delegates to validate transactions.

Consensus mechanisms are crucial for maintaining trust and security in decentralized systems.
