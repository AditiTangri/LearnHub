# Solidity Programming

Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Key Features
- **Statically Typed:** Variables must be declared with a type.
- **Contract-Oriented:** Code is organized into contracts.
- **Inheritance:** Supports multiple inheritance.

## Example
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greet = "Hello, World!";
}
```

Solidity is the most widely used language for Ethereum smart contracts.
