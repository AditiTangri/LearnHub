# Decentralized Apps (dApps)

Decentralized applications (dApps) are software applications that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer.

## Characteristics
- **Open Source:** Code is publicly available.
- **Decentralized:** No single point of control.
- **Incentivized:** Use tokens to reward participants.

## Examples

dApps are transforming industries by enabling trustless and transparent interactions.
