# Web3 Integration

Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, where decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts interact directly with blockchains.

## Key Concepts
- **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the network.
- **User Empowerment:** Users own their data and digital assets.
- **Interoperability:** dApps and services can work together seamlessly.

## Tools for Web3 Integration
- MetaMask (browser wallet)
- Web3.js & Ethers.js (JavaScript libraries)
- WalletConnect (connects wallets to dApps)

Web3 is enabling a more open, user-centric, and trustless web.
