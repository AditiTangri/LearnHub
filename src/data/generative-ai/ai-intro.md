# Introduction to Generative AI

Understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and generative models.

## Overview

Generative Artificial Intelligence represents one of the most exciting frontiers in technology today. Unlike traditional AI systems that classify or predict, generative AI creates new content - whether it's text, images, code, or even music.

At its core, generative AI uses machine learning models trained on vast amounts of data to understand patterns and relationships. These models can then generate new, original content that resembles the training data but is entirely unique.

The field has exploded with breakthrough technologies like:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and LLaMA
- Image generation models like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion
- Code generation tools like GitHub Copilot and CodeT5
- Video and audio generation systems

This course will take you from the fundamentals of AI to building your own generative applications, covering both the theory and practical implementation of these powerful technologies.
